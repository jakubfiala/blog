*This is the first post in a "Making of" series for my new web-based game, [Finding Gustavo](https://finding-gustavo.quest). In this series, I talk about the various techiques I used to turn Google Street View into a (sort of) game engine.*

As I'm writing this, Google Street View has been around for almost two decades. Not only is it very useful and an incredible feat of engineering,
it's also found its use as a creative tool. People have made [music videos](http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com/) and [audio tours](https://www.commarts.com/webpicks/google-night-walk) with it, and perhaps most famously, a game called [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) became a world sensation during the pandemic, dropping players onto random spots on the planet and letting them guess their location based on what they see.
